#### NLP application:

- Text classification and sentiment analysis: determining the topic and sentiment of a given text, for example, categorizing customer reviews as positive or negative
  - useful for analyzing customer feedback, social media posts, and reviews
  - performed at different levels, such as document level (determining the overall sentiment of a document), sentence level (determining the sentiment of each sentence), or aspect level (determining the sentiment of specific aspects or entities mentioned in the text)
  - challenges:
    - to represent the text data in a way that machine learning algorithms can understand
    - to deal with the nuances and complexities of human language, such as sarcasm, irony, and ambiguity, which can affect the accuracy of the predictions
- Machine translation: converting text from one language to another
- Named entity recognition: identifying and extracting named entities such as names, organizations, and locations from text
- Question answering: answering questions posed in natural language, such as the ones used by chatbots or virtual assistants
- Text summarization: summarizing long documents or articles to extract the most important information
